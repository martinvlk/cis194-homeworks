# Solutions to assignment exercises from the "CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)" course

My solutions to the assignments from the
["Introduction to Haskell" lecture](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13)
including all optional exercises. The lecture was used at 
[University of Pennsylvania | School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) in the Spring 2013 semester.

Note this project is managed using [stack](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2015/06/why-is-stack-not-cabal) - the new build tool for Haskell projects.

##To build
Just do `stack build`
