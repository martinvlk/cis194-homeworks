"CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell (Spring 2013)" course
Solutions to exercises.

My solutions to the assignments from the
["Introduction to Haskell" lecture](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13)
including all optional exercises. The lecture was used at 
[University of Pennsylvania | School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/) in the Spring 2013 semester.

Note this project is managed using [stack](https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2015/06/why-is-stack-not-cabal) - the new build tool for Haskell projects.

##Usage
Just do `stack build` to build the whole lot.

In order to run/use individual parts, please read the [homework
assignments](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html)
and see how each part is used.
